      <p class="jackfruitsText">
        Jackfruit isn't just a versatile meat substitute; it's a champion of
        sustainability. Here's how choosing jackfruit makes a positive impact on
        our planet

              <li>
                <b>Low Environmental Footprint:</b> Compared to traditional meat
                production, jackfruit requires significantly less land and water
                resources. Jackfruit trees are naturally productive, yielding
                abundant fruit with no environmental impact.

              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Reduces Deforestation and Soil Erosion:</b> Unlike
                resource-intensive livestock farming, jackfruit cultivation
                promotes sustainable land use. It minimizes deforestation and
                soil erosion, protecting precious ecosystems and promoting
                biodiversity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Promotes Efficient Resource Utilization:</b> Jackfruit trees
                are known for their drought tolerance, thriving in environments
                where other crops struggle. This translates to less water waste
                and efficient resource utilization in agriculture
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Renewable Food Source:</b> Jackfruit trees are perennial,
                meaning they produce fruit for many years. This ensures a
                reliable and renewable source of food, contributing to long-term
                food security.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Reduces Reliance on Factory Farming:</b> The rise of
                jackfruit consumption lessens the demand for factory-farmed
                meats, a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and
                environmental pollution.

              Choosing jackfruit over animal meat can significantly reduce your
              dietary carbon footprint. Jackfruit compares favorably to other
              plant-based options, especially those relying on
              resource-intensive crops like soy.

                <b>Animal Meat Production (Beef):</b> Highest footprint, ranging
                from 50-60 kg CO2e per kg of protein. This is due to factors
                like animal feed production, land use changes for grazing, and
                methane emissions from livestock
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Lamb and Goat Meat:</b> Lower than beef, but still
                significant at 20-40 kg CO2e per kg of protein
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Pork and Chicken:</b> Less impactful than red meat, with
                footprints around 5-10 kg CO2e per kg of protein
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Plant-Based Meat Alternatives (Soy-based):</b> While
                generally lower than meat, soy production can involve
                deforestation and transportation emissions. Estimates range from
                2-8 kg CO2e per kg of protein

              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Jackfruit Production:</b> Significantly lower footprint
                compared to all the above options, estimated at 0.5-2 kg CO2e
                per kg of protein. This is due to jackfruit trees' efficiency,
                requiring less land and resources than livestock or even some
                plant-based alternatives.
