        <h3>Pulled Jackfruit BBQ Sandwiches</h3>
        <p>Intructions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prepare the Jackfruit: Drain and rinse the jackfruit, then cut it
            into smaller pieces. Remove any hard seeds and set the jackfruit
            aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the Onion and Garlic: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over
            medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until soft and
            caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for
            another 1-2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Spices and Jackfruit: Stir in the smoked paprika, chili powder,
            cumin, salt, and pepper. Add the jackfruit pieces and toss to coat
            them in the spice mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer in BBQ Sauce: Pour in the BBQ sauce, mixing well to ensure
            the jackfruit is evenly coated. Reduce the heat and let it simmer
            for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jackfruit is
            tender and easily pulled apart with a fork.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assemble the Sandwiches: Using two forks, shred the jackfruit to
            create a "pulled" texture. Serve the pulled jackfruit on whole-grain
            buns with coleslaw, if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serving Suggestion: These sandwiches pair well with sweet potato
            fries or a fresh salad.

        <h3>JackFruit Curry</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Prepare the Jackfruit: If using canned jackfruit, drain and rinse it
            thoroughly. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the Aromatics: Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium
            heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds
            until fragrant. Add the diced onions and cook until translucent,
            about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cooking for another
            2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Spices: Stir in the curry powder, turmeric, salt, and pepper,
            cooking for 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer the Curry: Add the jackfruit pieces to the pot and stir to
            coat them with the spice mixture. Pour in the diced tomatoes and
            tomato paste, mixing well. Add the coconut milk and bring the
            mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat and let the curry cook for
            25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jackfruit is tender
            and the sauce has thickened.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve: Garnish the curry with fresh cilantro and serve over basmati
            rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serving Suggestion: Enjoy this curry with warm naan bread or a side
            of steamed vegetables.
