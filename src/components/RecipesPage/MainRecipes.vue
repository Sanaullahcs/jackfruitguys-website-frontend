            <li>
              Prepare Jackfruit: If using canned jackfruit, drain, rinse, and
              shred it into smaller pieces. If fresh, peel and cut it into
              bite-sized pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat Oil: In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

              brown (about 1 minute).
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook Jackfruit: Add the shredded jackfruit to the pan and stir to
              coat with the garlic and oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Season: Sprinkle in the paprika, red chili flakes (if using),
              salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simmer: Let the jackfruit cook for about 10-12 minutes, stirring
              occasionally until it's crispy on the edges.
            </li>
            <li>

              Boil raw jackfruit pieces in salted water until tender, then drain

            Tortilla española con patatas y cebolla
          </h3>

          <ol class="jackfruitsText px-4">
            <li>
              Start by peeling and thinly slicing four medium potatoes and one
              large onion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat about 200 ml of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium
              heat, ensuring there's enough oil to submerge the potatoes and
              onions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the oil is hot, add the sliced potatoes and onions to the
              pan. Stir occasionally to coat them with oil, and cook for around
              20 minutes on low to medium heat until the potatoes are soft but
              not browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the potatoes and onions are cooking, crack six large eggs
              into a large bowl, season with salt, and beat them well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the potatoes and onions are cooked, remove them from the oil
              using a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the potatoes and onions cool slightly before adding them to
              the beaten eggs. Stir everything together, ensuring the potatoes
              and onions are well-coated with the egg mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a small amount of the reserved olive oil in a clean,
              non-stick frying pan over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the egg, potato, and onion mixture into the pan, spreading it
              evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook the tortilla on one side for about 5-7 minutes until the
              edges start to set and the bottom is golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flip the tortilla by placing a large plate over the pan, turning
              the pan over, and sliding the tortilla back into the pan to cook
              the other side for another 3-5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once fully cooked, slide the tortilla onto a plate and let it cool
              slightly before serving.
            </li>

            Ensalada de Tomate con Cebolla y Anchoas
          </h3>

          <ol class="jackfruitsText px-4">
            <li>
              Start by preparing the jackfruit. If you're using canned young
              jackfruit, drain and rinse it well. Shred the jackfruit into small
              pieces using your hands or a fork. If using fresh young jackfruit,
              cut it into bite-sized pieces. Lightly sauté it in olive oil with
              a pinch of salt and pepper for added flavor (optional).
            </li>
            <li>
              Wash and slice four ripe tomatoes into thick rounds. Peel and
              thinly slice a small white onion into thin rings or strips. Lay
              the tomato slices on a serving plate, and on top of the tomatoes,
              evenly distribute the sliced onions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place the shredded, lightly cooked jackfruit on top of the tomato
              and onion layers, ensuring it’s well-distributed. Drizzle a
              generous amount of olive oil over the salad, and optionally, add a
              splash of vinegar or lemon juice for extra tang. Season with salt
              and black pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              For an extra crunch, you can add toasted garlic chips or fried
              onions as a garnish on top of the salad. Let the salad sit for a
              few minutes to allow the flavors to combine, then serve fresh.
            </li>

          <h3 class="jackfruitsHeadingSmall">JackFruit Paella</h3>

          <ol class="jackfruitsText px-4">
            <li>
              Prepare Jackfruit: If using canned jackfruit, drain, rinse, and
              shred it into small pieces with your hands or a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sauté Vegetables: Heat olive oil in a large, wide pan (preferably
              a paella pan) over medium heat. Add diced onion and garlic,
              sautéing until they become soft and fragrant (about 3-4 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook Jackfruit and Bell Peppers: Add the shredded jackfruit and
              bell pepper slices to the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring
              occasionally, until the jackfruit and peppers are lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Season: Stir in the diced tomato, smoked paprika, saffron (if
              using), turmeric, and salt. Let the flavors combine for a minute.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add Rice: Pour the rice into the pan and stir to coat it with the
              seasonings and oil. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour Broth: Gradually add the vegetable broth to the pan, stirring
              to distribute it evenly. Once the broth is added, avoid stirring
              to achieve the traditional crispy layer at the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simmer: Lower the heat to medium-low and let the paella simmer
              uncovered for 15-20 minutes. Add the peas in the last 5 minutes of
              cooking. The broth should be absorbed, and the rice should be
              tender. If the rice is still too hard, add a little more broth or
              water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rest: Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and
              cover it with a kitchen towel for 5 minutes to allow the flavors
              to meld.
            </li>
            <li>
              Garnish and Serve: Garnish the paella with fresh parsley and lemon
              wedges. Serve hot!
